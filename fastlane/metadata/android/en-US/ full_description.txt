Having the right meme or sound at the right time can make a joke work! Sounds are so much fun and this is why you need to download OMGSoundboard.
OMGSoundboard allows you to create your own unique soundboards. What's exciting about this app is that it allows you to be only limited by your imagination. You are free to use whatever sounds you want. You can also record directly from your phone's microphone or import from a sound file. The software is simple and straightforward to use. You can also layer the sounds by adding effects and playing several sound effects at once.

OMGSoundboard also has an offline mode, a good search function, and the ability to set sounds as ringtones.

Please note that OMGSoundboard has just a very limited amount of sounds available because of copyright reasons.
